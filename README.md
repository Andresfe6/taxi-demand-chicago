# 🚕 Chicago Taxi Demand Project

This project analyzes historical taxi trip data from Chicago to predict hourly demand using regression models. It combines data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and machine 
learning techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand patterns in taxi demand by hour and day
- Build regression models to predict future demand
- Compare model performance (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Optimize performance based on RMSE metric

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files
- `Taxis Chicago Project.ipynb`: Complete notebook including data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation

## 🚀 How to run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Run the cells in order
